This is a student project, part of the Odin Project (http://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum to learn web development.

The goal was to use Javascript and JQuery to build a browser version of a something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

This page uses JQuery to create a grid, then, when hovering the mouse over the grid, a function changes the background color of each square. The buttons allow the user to reset the grid with a custom definition, draw in a random color, go back to the default color (white), and use an eraser.
